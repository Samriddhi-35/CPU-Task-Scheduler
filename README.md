# CPU Scheduling Simulator in C++
This repository contains implementations of CPU scheduling algorithms in C++, aimed for educational and interview practice purposes. It supports both offline and online scheduling algorithms with modular C++ code.

## Features

### Offline Schedulers
- First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

Offline schedulers simulate a fixed list of processes scheduled in different ways.

### Online Schedulers
- Shortest Job First (SJF) with burst history prediction
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) with dynamic job arrivals via non-blocking input

Online schedulers simulate realistic system environments where processes arrive at runtime.
